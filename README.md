## Python Interface
Interface made with the python language using the CutomTkinter library, unifying all my scripts and plotting some important information!

## :warning: Prerequisites

- [CustomTkinter](https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/)

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/)

- [Subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html](https://docs.python.org/pt-br/dev/library/subprocess.html))

## OBSERVATION

This code will only work if you change the file directories and change the API URL!
